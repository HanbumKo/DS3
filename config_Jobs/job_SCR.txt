# Configuration file of the Single Carrier Receiver
# Lines that start with "#" are comments
# Start with specifying the job name with keyword: job_name
# Then, in the next line, add tasks using the keyword: add_new_tasks
# After that the following three lines must have the attributes below
# $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
# $task_name (string) HEAD (TAIL), if the task is the head or tail of the task graph
# $task_name (string) $earliest_start (int) $deadline (int) $input_vol (int - bits) $output_vol (int - bits)
# The format: add_new_tasks $num_of_tasks (int)
#             $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
#             $task_name (string) HEAD (string)  
#             $task_name (string) $earliest_start (int) $deadline (int) $input_vol (int) $output_vol (int)
# Example: The following lines add a new task with ID=0, and
#          there is no predecessor for this task
#          (empty list means there is no dependency)
#          This task is the head of the task graph
#          earliest start time and deadline are 0 and 10, respectively
#          input and output volumes are 1024 bits
#
#          add_new_tasks 1
#          scrambler 0 
#          scrambler HEAD
#          scrambler earliest_start 0 deadline 10 input_vol 1024 output_vol 1024
#
# After adding tasks, use keyword comm_vol to add communication volume for
# the tasks that have dependencies 
# The format: comm_vol $source_id (int) $destination_id (int) volume (int)
# Example: The following line adds communication volume between task 0 (source)
#          and task 1 (destination)
#                    
#          comm_vol 0 1 5
