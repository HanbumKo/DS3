This file keeps a list of common conventions used throughout DASH-Sim

1- NAMING CONVENTIONS:

- The class names are initial capitalized. When they contain two words,
each one is initial capitalized

Examples: Resource, ResourceManager

- The object names are all lower case.
When they contain more than one word, the words are separated by an underscore

Examples: resource_matrix

2- MESSAGES PRINTED BY DASH-SIM

- DASH-Sim prints a variety of messages. An identifier at the beginning of
the line describes the type of the message.

    [D]: (D)ebugging messages. For example, messages printed during
         parsing and elaboration related messages.
    [I]: (I)nformation messages about the events that happen during the simulation
    [E]: (E)rror messages

3- PRIVATE VARIABLES

From: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html

“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an
object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed
by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam)
should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function,
a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail
and subject to change without notice."

DASH-Sim follows the same convention.

4- IMPORTING PYTHON libraries and custom classes/functions

Each files starts with importing classes/functions used therein.
The convention is to import first built-in Python files.
Then, the custom DASH-Sim files are imported after a blank line
